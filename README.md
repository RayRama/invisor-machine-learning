# INVISOR - Personal Interview Advisor

**INVISOR** aims to improve students' interview skills and communication to increase their employability. It aligns with several United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by providing students with the necessary skills to compete in the workforce and contribute to a more inclusive job market. The project will develop an AI-powered interview training platform that provides personalized feedback and allows students to practice answering common interview questions.

## How this project relates to SDGs

- **SDG 4: Quality Education** - Our project fosters inclusive education by equipping learners with essential interview skills, enhancing employability, and promoting equitable opportunities in the workforce.
- **SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth** - We support SDG 8 by empowering students with interview skills, fostering economic growth through enhanced employability, and advancing a more inclusive job market.
- **SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals** - The project emphasizes global collaboration for sustainable development, utilizing AI technology to create an innovative solution. Future partnerships with various organizations aim to enhance accessibility and benefit students globally.

## Topic and Motivation

The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in guiding multilingual job interviews has become a significant topic in human resource development. In this context, it is important to understand how the principles of artificial intelligence can be applied wisely to enhance interview skills and expand global employment opportunities. This study will explore the potential use of AI in conducting job interviews by considering perspectives from the Quran and Hadith on education, communication, and job opportunities.
